Feed Reader Web App Testing with Jasmine
=========

# Project Overview

In this project I wrote unit tests in Jasmine for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. To run this application clone or download the repo and open up index.html in your browser. This app uses some ES6 syntax so make sure to use an ES6 compatible browser.

# What does this web app do?

This is a simple feed reader. You can click on the menu icon to bring up the different feeds that are being displayed. Click on any of the article links to navigate to that article in the feed. 

# Issues / To Do's:

1. The testing logic for switching the feeds can be improved. 
2. The ES6 can be compiled down to ES5 using Babel to improve cross browser compatibility.
